Computation project. Simulates Ising
Model and obtain critical temperature
using a 100*100 lattice.

We solve Ising model by using Monte Carlo simulation, which
randomly samples from the possible states with probability informed
by Boltzmann statistics. We are interested in finding the critical
temperature which causes magnets to lose magnetization and have a 
sudden change in physical properties. By solving Ising Model, we 
can predict the critical temperature as the same predicted by 
analytical results.
